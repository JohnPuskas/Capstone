          <h2>About This Application</h2>
          <p>
            This application was inspired by version control in the software world.
            In the software development, version history is easy to track.
            With each change, developers add a small message that describes changes that were made.
            A list of all changes throughout a project can be viewed all in one place simultaneously.
            As a music producer, I thought wouldn't it be nice if we had something like this for song projects?
            In large projects, I would lose track of which iteration contained what changes.
            Sometimes I would need to go back to grab something from an old file to place into the current version.
            Without a system in place like offered with this application,
            I would find myself going through the lengthy process of opening and closing individual song version files
            throughout the history of the song until I (hopefully) could sort through things and find what I was looking for.

          <p>
            My name is John Puskas. In addition to being a music producer, I am also a full stack web developer.
            I have prior experience with C#/.NET and Python, and I am learning to use JavaScript
            as a full stack web development tool.
            This application represents my first foray into the world of full stack JS development.
